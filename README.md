Got Milk? Also comes with nifty features such as; a measurement conversion tool and the ability to download your favorites recipes.

### Identify
This application is intended to help users save money. Many times i get take away because i do not have the ingredients to make the meals i want. This app solves this problem because now users are able to list the ingredients they have in the kitchen and have the app return a list a recipes that the user can make.

The target audience is intended for young adults who may be finding their footing around the kitchen an do not know where to start. Also, young adults are often the demographic that needs to save money and buying take out several times a week does not help.

## Functionality / Features
Got milk? Defines 3 distinct features 
First being, the ability to search through stored recipes in a json object and return the recipe or recipes that match the userâ€™s input to the recipes ingredients. 

Then we have the feature to save recipes into a text file so that the user does not need to open the app and shift through menus just to find a recipe that they like and want to make again. Or maybe the user just wants to be able to print the recipe to paper.

And also, Got milk? Features a measurement conversion tool that will convert common cooking measurements of either metric to US imperial and vice versa.
